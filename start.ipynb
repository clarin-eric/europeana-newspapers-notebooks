    "# Using Jupyter Notebooks to Process Europeana Newspaper Text Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks have been designed to help you get started processing historical text resources\n",
    "(from [Europeana Newspapers](https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections/topic/18-newspapers))\n",
    "with natural language processing (NLP) tools (from [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get familiar with the data\n",
    "* Browse the [Europeana Newspapers portal](https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections/topic/18-newspapers)\n",
    "* Browse the newspaper resources in the [Virtual Language Observatory](https://vlo.clarin.eu/search?fq=collection:Europeana+newspapers+full-text)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get access to a Jupyter environment\n",
    "If you are not already accessing this inside a Jupyter environment, make sure that you get access. You may have access to such an environment through your institution, but you can also use of a public \"Binder\" platform for free and without registration. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/clarin-eric/europeana-newspapers-notebooks) for this collection of notebooks and click the `Launch binder` badge to get started within a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieve the data\n",
    "If you are working with these notebooks for the first time and/or in a new environment, you will not yet have data, i.e. the newspaper full text resources, locally available. You will need a copy of the data for the set(s) that you will be working with to run most of the notebooks. Data can be retrieved and unpacked locally by running the full [retrieve data notebook](./util/retrieve_data.ipynb). Click on the link to go there, and follow the instructions that you will find at the start of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Follow the tutorial\n",
    "The tutorial consists of three chapters. Start by opening the [first chapter](./tutorial/demo/Chapter1.ipynb), then read and carry out the cells one by one while examing their output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or jumpy directly to a chapter of interest:\n",
    "- [Chapter 1: XML and CMDI introduction](./tutorial/demo/Chapter1.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Chapter 2: Data selection and resource access](./tutorial/demo/Chapter2.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Chapter 3: NLP processing](./tutorial/demo/Chapter3.ipynb) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Work on the excercise notebooks\n",
    "Start with [Exercise 1](./tutorial/exercises/Exercise1.ipynb) and follow the pointers from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Doing more\n",
    "- Take a look at the scripts in the `examples` directory\n",
    "- Use texts from other languages, eras and/or sources\n",
    "- Scrape text from online sources with [Newspaper3k](https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
